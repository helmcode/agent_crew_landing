    <h1>Documentation</h1>

    <p>
      AgentCrew is an open-source AI agent orchestrator. Just as Kubernetes
      orchestrates containers regardless of what application runs inside,
      AgentCrew orchestrates AI agents regardless of their purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
      Create teams of specialized agents for any domain: software engineering,
      marketing, finance, data analysis, content creation, operations, or
      anything else. Agent specialization is driven entirely by documentation:
      write Markdown instructions describing what each agent should do, and
      AgentCrew handles deployment, communication, and coordination.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently powered by Claude Code, with support for additional AI
      providers and models planned.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>

    <h3>Teams</h3>
    <p>
      A team is a group of AI agents that work together on a shared mission.
      Each team runs in its own isolated environment (Docker containers with a
      dedicated NATS messaging bus). You can have multiple teams running
      simultaneously, each focused on a different project or domain.
    </p>

    <h3>Agents: Leader + Workers</h3>
    <p>
      Every team has exactly one <strong>leader</strong> and one or more
      <strong>workers</strong>. The leader receives your messages, breaks down
      the work, and delegates to workers. Workers are specialist agents defined
      by Markdown files. Their role, instructions, and behavior are entirely
      determined by the documentation you write. A worker can be anything: a
      "Content Strategist", a "Financial Analyst", a "Backend Developer", or a
      "Legal Reviewer". The same orchestration platform, infinite use cases.
    </p>

    <h3>Documentation-Driven Specialization</h3>
    <p>
      The core of AgentCrew is that agents are defined by text. The system
      generates structured files that determine each agent's behavior:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>CLAUDE.md</strong>: The leader's instructions, team context, and delegation protocol.</li>
      <li><strong>agents/*.md</strong>: One file per worker, with YAML frontmatter (name, model, skills) and a Markdown body containing detailed instructions.</li>
      <li><strong>Skills</strong>: Installable extensions from GitHub repos that give agents additional capabilities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This documentation-driven approach means you can create agents for any
      purpose without writing a single line of code. Describe what the agent
      should do, and it becomes that specialist.
    </p>

    <h3>Skills</h3>
    <p>
      Skills are extensions that give agents specialized capabilities sourced
      from GitHub repositories. Skills can be installed on individual workers
      (agent-specific) or on the leader (global, shared with all agents in the
      team). They allow you to extend what your agents can do without modifying
      their core instructions.
    </p>

    <h3>Workspaces</h3>
    <p>
      A workspace is a directory mounted into the agent container at
      <code>/workspace</code>. It gives agents access to your project files,
      including source code, documents, data, and configuration, so they can read, edit, and
      create files on your behalf. Workspaces persist across sessions.
