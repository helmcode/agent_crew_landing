    <h1>Documentation</h1>

    <p>
      AgentCrew is a multi-agent AI team orchestrator powered by Claude Code.
      It lets you define teams of specialized AI agents that collaborate to
      accomplish complex tasks — from writing code and reviewing pull requests
      to managing infrastructure and running security audits.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead of chatting with a single AI assistant, AgentCrew lets you spin
      up an entire team where each agent has a distinct role, custom
      instructions, and specialized skills. A leader agent coordinates the
      work and delegates tasks to worker agents automatically.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>

    <h3>Teams</h3>
    <p>
      A team is a group of AI agents that work together. Each team runs in its
      own isolated environment (Docker containers with a dedicated NATS
      messaging bus). You can have multiple teams running simultaneously, each
      focused on a different project or task.
    </p>

    <h3>Agents: Leader + Workers</h3>
    <p>
      Every team has exactly one <strong>leader</strong> and one or more
      <strong>workers</strong>. The leader receives your messages, breaks down
      the work, and delegates to workers. Workers are specialized agents — for
      example, a "Frontend Developer", a "Backend Developer", or a "Security
      Auditor". Workers are defined as Markdown files and spawned by Claude
      Code as sub-agents.
    </p>

    <h3>Skills</h3>
    <p>
      Skills are extensions that give agents specialized capabilities sourced
      from GitHub repositories. Skills can be installed on individual workers
      (agent-specific) or on the leader (global, shared with all agents in the
      team). They allow you to extend what your agents can do without modifying
      their core instructions.
    </p>

    <h3>Workspaces</h3>
    <p>
      A workspace is a directory mounted into the agent container at
      <code>/workspace</code>. It gives agents access to your project files —
      source code, configuration, documentation — so they can read, edit, and
      create files on your behalf. Workspaces persist across sessions.
