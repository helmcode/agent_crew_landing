    <h1>Skills</h1>

    <p>
      Skills are extensions that give agents specialized capabilities sourced
      from GitHub repositories. They let you expand what your agents can do
      without modifying their core instructions, from interacting with
      external APIs to following project-specific coding standards.
    </p>

    <h2>How Skills Work</h2>

    <p>
      Under the hood, skills are installed using the skills CLI:
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-bash">npx skills add &lt;github_repo_url&gt; --skill &lt;skill_name&gt; --agent claude-code -y</code></pre>

    <p>
      This command fetches the skill definition from a GitHub repository and
      installs it into the agent's environment. Once installed, the skill
      becomes part of the agent's available capabilities and the agent can
      use it automatically when relevant.
    </p>

    <h2>Types of Skills</h2>

    <h3>Agent Skills (Worker-Specific)</h3>

    <p>
      Agent skills are installed on a specific worker and are only available to
      that worker. Use these when a capability is relevant to just one role.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, you might install a Kubernetes skill only on your "DevOps
      Engineer" worker, or a React testing skill only on your "Frontend
      Developer" worker.
    </p>

    <h3>Global Skills (Leader)</h3>

    <p>
      Global skills are installed on the <strong>leader</strong> agent and are
      automatically shared with <strong>all agents</strong> in the team. They
      appear in every worker's configuration, making them available across the
      entire team.
    </p>

    <p>
      Use global skills for capabilities that every agent should have, such as
      project conventions, documentation standards, or shared tooling
      integrations.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <strong>Tip:</strong> In the UI, the leader agent is labeled with
      <strong>"(global)"</strong> to indicate that skills installed on it are
      shared with all team members.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Adding Skills During Team Creation</h2>

    <p>
      When creating a new team, you can attach skills in <strong>Step 2</strong>
      of the creation wizard:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Leader skills (global):</strong> In the leader configuration
        section, add skills by providing the GitHub repository URL and skill
        name. These will be available to all agents.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Worker skills:</strong> In each worker's configuration section,
        add skills specific to that worker's role. These will only be available
        to that particular worker.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Each skill entry requires:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Repository URL</strong>: The GitHub repository containing the skill (e.g., <code>https://github.com/anthropics/skills</code>)</li>
      <li><strong>Skill name</strong>: The name of the skill within that repository (e.g., <code>create-react-app</code>)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Finding Skills</h2>

    <p>
      You can discover available skills and find the exact repository URL and
      skill name you need at <a href="https://skills.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>skills.sh</strong></a>.
      Browse or search the directory to find skills relevant to your agents'
      roles, then copy the GitHub URL and skill name directly into AgentCrew.
    </p>

    <h2>Adding Skills to Running Teams</h2>

    <p>
      You can also add skills to teams that are already running:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Open the team's chat view.</li>
      <li>Click the <strong>Settings</strong> icon to open the team settings modal.</li>
      <li>Select any agent from the list:
        <ul>
          <li>Select the <strong>leader (global)</strong> to add skills shared with all agents.</li>
          <li>Select a specific <strong>worker</strong> to add skills only for that worker.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Add the new skill with its repository URL and skill name.</li>
      <li>Save the changes. The skill will be installed on the next agent restart.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Storage and Discovery</h2>

    <p>
      Skills are organized in two directories inside the agent container:
    </p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Directory</th>
          <th>Purpose</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><code>.agents/skills/</code></td>
          <td>Contains the actual skill files downloaded from GitHub repositories.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>.claude/skills/</code></td>
          <td>Contains symlinks pointing to <code>.agents/skills/</code>. This is how the AI agent discovers and loads installed skills.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      This two-directory structure separates skill storage from skill
      discovery. The <code>.agents/skills/</code> directory holds the source of
      truth, while <code>.claude/skills/</code> provides the interface that
      the agent expects.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-text">/workspace/
  .agents/
    skills/
      create-react-app/      # Actual skill files
      kubernetes-ops/         # Actual skill files
  .claude/
    skills/
      create-react-app → ../../.agents/skills/create-react-app   # Symlink
      kubernetes-ops   → ../../.agents/skills/kubernetes-ops      # Symlink
    agents/
      frontend-dev.md        # Worker agent definition
      devops-engineer.md     # Worker agent definition
    CLAUDE.md                # Leader instructions</code></pre>
